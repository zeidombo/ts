When I was young, I written a piece to me that made me reflect, and as years go by and i learn more and more about the nature of computer Sciences,
from building large scale software, programming a sub-system to do some business feature, designing some pre-existing algorithnm and data structure, to building
some sort of quick hack script to do some repetitive task, I always come back to this piece of writing and reflect on it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. And much do I like to seeing me
writing these sort of things in high school, I've yearned for the day to come back and write more of these things and often times, correcting it.

When I hear the word “programming” or “coding,” I think of companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and every successful software company out there. I think of the people who built this company from scratch just by having an idea and the will to make it happen. Programming, to me, is a tool that allows you to build something innovative. I see computer programming as a way to express yourself. It allows you to build projects such as mobile apps, websites, and video games then share it to your friends or random strangers over the internet.

I first started programming when a friend of mine during my middle school years first introduced me what computer programming is. Since we liked tech, coding easily became a hobby of mine. My first time learning coding was when I bought a book called “The Beginner’s Guide to C++” by Oleg Yaroshenko. As a kid, It was hard to process what the book was all about. But i still continued reading it anyways. So, in all, programming is part of who I am. It made me get into computers more and is the reason why I wanted to get into the tech field as my future career.
