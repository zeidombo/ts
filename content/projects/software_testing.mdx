# Comprehensive Guide to Software Testing Types

A complete overview of various software testing methodologies, their purposes, and sample code implementations.

## 1. Unit Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Testing individual units or components of the software.
**When to Use:** During development to ensure each component functions correctly.
```javascript
// JavaScript example using Jest
test('adds 1 + 1 to equal 2', () => {
  expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
});
```

## 2. Integration Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Testing combined components to evaluate the interactions between them.
**When to Use:** After unit testing, to ensure modules work together.
```javascript
// Python example using unittest
class TestIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_integration(self):
        response = my_module.function_a()
        self.assertEqual(response, expected_response)
```

## 3. System Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Testing the complete and integrated software system.
**When to Use:** After integration testing, to validate the overall software.
```text
// Typically involves a combination of tests and tools, not represented by a single code snippet.
```

## 4. Acceptance Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Testing the system against user requirements.
**When to Use:** Before the software release, to ensure it meets user needs.
```text
// Involves user feedback and scenarios, not typically represented by code.
```

## 5. Performance Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Testing how the software performs under various conditions.
**When to Use:** To assess speed, responsiveness, and stability.
```text
// Often uses tools like JMeter; not a simple code example.
```

## 6. Regression Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Testing existing software functionalities after changes.
**When to Use:** After any software update or bug fix.
```javascript
// JavaScript example using Mocha
describe('Regression Tests', function() {
  it('should pass all the existing tests', function() {
    // Existing test scenarios
  });
});
```

## 7. Smoke Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Preliminary testing to check the basic functionality.
**When to Use:** Before detailed testing to catch high-level issues.
```javascript
// Simple test to check if a system crashes or not
if (system.startsSuccessfully()) {
  // Proceed with further testing
}
```

## 8. Security Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Identifying vulnerabilities and security loopholes.
**When to Use:** Throughout development, especially for web and network applications.
```text
// Involves specialized tools and techniques, not represented by a single code snippet.
```

## 9. Usability Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Assessing the user interface and user experience.
**When to Use:** To gauge user satisfaction and ease of use.
```text
// Involves user surveys and feedback, not typically represented by code.
```

## 10. Compatibility Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Ensuring software compatibility across different environments.
**When to Use:** To guarantee software runs on various systems and devices.
```javascript
// Example using Selenium for browser compatibility
driver.get('http://yourwebsite.com');
// Assert conditions for different browsers
```

Absolutely, there are several other types of software testing that can be included in your comprehensive guide. Let's continue the list:

## 11. Load Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Evaluating the system's performance under high load.
**When to Use:** To ensure the application can handle expected user traffic.
```javascript
// Example with Artillery for load testing
const script = {
  config: {
    target: 'http://yourapp.com',
    phases: [{ duration: 60, arrivalRate: 20 }]
  },
  scenarios: [{ flow: [{ get: { url: '/' } }] }]
};
artillery.run(script);
```

## 12. Stress Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Determining the limits of the system under extreme conditions.
**When to Use:** To understand the system's breaking points and ensure stability.
```text
// Involves tools like JMeter; not represented by a single code snippet.
```

## 13. Exploratory Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Testing the software without predefined test cases or scripts.
**When to Use:** To uncover unexpected issues and explore software behavior.
```text
// More about tester's experience and intuition, not easily represented by code.
```

## 14. API Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Testing the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for functionality, reliability, and security.
**When to Use:** To ensure that APIs meet expectations for performance, reliability, and security.
```javascript
// JavaScript example using Mocha for API testing
describe('API Endpoints', () => {
  it('should return 200 for GET /', done => {
    request(app)
      .get('/')
      .expect(200, done);
  });
});
```

## 15. Mobile Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Testing the functionality and usability of mobile applications.
**When to Use:** To ensure mobile apps work effectively across different devices and operating systems.
```text
// Often uses mobile testing frameworks; not represented by a single code snippet.
```

## 16. Accessibility Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Ensuring that the software is usable by people with disabilities.
**When to Use:** To comply with accessibility standards and improve user inclusiveness.
```text
// Involves tools like axe for web accessibility testing; not a single code example.
```

## 17. Beta Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Releasing the software to a limited audience outside the organization.
**When to Use:** Before the final release to get real user feedback.
```text
// Involves real user feedback; not typically represented by code.
```

## 18. A/B Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Comparing two versions of a software to determine which performs better.
**When to Use:** For optimizing software based on user preferences and behaviors.
```javascript
// JavaScript example for A/B testing setup
if (experimentVariant === 'A') {
  // Show version A of the feature
} else {
  // Show version B of the feature
}
```

## 19. Static Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Analyzing the software without actually executing the code.

  it('completes a typical user journey', () => {
    cy.visit('http://example.com');
    cy.get('#start').click();
    // More steps to complete the journey
    cy.get('#finish').should('contain', 'Done');
  });
});
```

## 25. Non-Functional Testing
**Elevator Pitch:** Testing the non-functional aspects of the software like performance, usability, and reliability.
