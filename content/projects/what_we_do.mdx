2. **Analyzing Requirements**
3. **Writing Software Requirements Documents**
4. **Building and Analyzing Prototypes**
5. **Developing Software Designs**
6. **Writing Software Design Documents**
7. **Researching Software Engineering Techniques** or obtaining information about the application domain
8. **Developing Test Strategies and Test Cases**
9. **Testing the Software** and recording the results
10. **Isolating Problems and Solving Them**
11. **Learning to Use** or installing and configuring new software and hardware tools
12. **Writing Documentation** such as users manuals
