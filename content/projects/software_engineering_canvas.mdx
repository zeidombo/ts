During my entrepeneurship class, one of the first 'mental models' that we've been encoded
was the "Business Model Canvas", or a hollisitc ecosystem-ique view of how a startup, and even fully established
businesses operate. It's essentially a framework or a guiding principle that sees how businesses flows,
and how it can be improved, through iterative feedback.

We can do the same for software systems, deconstructing software for us, humans, to plan and manage software projects.
This canvas would focus on the key components of software development and maintenance, ensuring a holistic and balanced approach,
and essentially the activitie(s) of what comprises of a Software Engineer

System Architecture:

Description: The high-level structure of the software, including its components and their interactions.
Examples: Microservices, monoliths, serverless architecture.


User Experience (UX) Design:
Description: How users interact with the software, focusing on ease of use, accessibility, and user satisfaction.
Examples: Interface design principles, accessibility standards, user journey maps.


Security and Compliance:
Description: Measures and practices to protect the software from threats and ensure compliance with relevant laws and standards.
Examples: Encryption, authentication mechanisms, GDPR compliance.


Development Methodology:
Description: The approach to software development, including practices, processes, and tools used.
Examples: Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, DevOps practices.


Performance and Scalability:
Description: How the software performs under varying loads and its ability to grow to meet demand.
Examples: Load balancing strategies, database optimization, cloud scalability solutions.


Technology Stack:
Description: The set of technologies used to build and run the software, including programming languages, frameworks, and databases.
Examples: JavaScript, React, Python, AWS, SQL/NoSQL databases.


Testing and Quality Assurance:
Description: Processes and practices to ensure the software functions correctly and meets quality standards.
Examples: Unit testing, integration testing, automated testing tools.


Deployment and Operations:
Description: How the software is deployed, updated, and maintained in a production environment.
Examples: Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), monitoring tools, cloud hosting.


Maintenance and Support:
Description: Ongoing support and updates for the software, addressing bugs, and improving functionality.
Examples: Support ticket systems, version control, software update policies.


Stakeholder Engagement:
Description: Interaction with and management of stakeholders' expectations, including users, clients, and team members.
Examples: User feedback channels, stakeholder meetings, communication tools.


Cost and Resource Management:
Description: Budgeting, resource allocation, and cost control in the software development lifecycle.
Examples: Cloud cost optimization, resource planning tools, ROI calculations.


Innovation and Growth:
Description: Strategies for evolving the software and adopting new technologies or methodologies.
Examples: R&D, exploring emerging technologies, market trend analysis.
Each of these components addresses a crucial aspect of software system design and management, ensuring a comprehensive view of the project. By filling out a canvas with these components, teams can gain a clearer understanding of their software system's current state, areas for improvement, and strategies for future development. This approach facilitates a more structured and strategic way of managing software development, similar to how the Business Model Canvas guides business strategy.

Albeit, the software system canvas is the anti-thesis of iterative and dynamic nature of busniness model canvas,
one coudld argue that this is primarily a strategic long-term planning rather than frequent, dynamic changes.
Software System Canvas is more about setting a direction and understanding implications rather than rapid iteration,
since iteration comes with a huge cost in software development.
